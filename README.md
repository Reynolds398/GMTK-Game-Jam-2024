# Ace-corn! (GMTK Game Jam 2024 Submission)
This is the GitHub repo that was used to create the prototype for the GMTK Game Jam 2024. 
We created this prototype using Godot as our game engine. 
You can pull this repo and import the project into Godot to run it but we highly recommend downloading the executable from our submission at itch.io to run it instead.

Here is the link to our game: https://thegamerstrategy.itch.io/ace-corn.
